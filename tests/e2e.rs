//! End-to-end coverage of the built `busbar-store-sqlite-plugin` cdylib, loaded over the REAL
//! `busbar-plugin-loader` C ABI seam (`load_store`) — the exact seam busbar's engine uses when
//! `governance.store: sqlite` drops this plugin into its plugins folder. This is a real `dlopen`,
//! real FFI, real SQLite-file test, not a call into the Rust functions directly.
//!
//! Ported from the monorepo's `busbar-plugin-loader::tests::load_and_exercise_sqlite_plugin_*`
//! (`crates/plugin-loader/src/lib.rs`), which is where this plugin's real ABI-crossing coverage
//! historically lived (since the monorepo's `plugin-loader` crate owns the loader used to dlopen
//! it). This repo carries its own copy so every push to `GetBusbar/store-sqlite` proves, for real,
//! over the C ABI, that the plugin loads and correctly persists data — mirroring the pattern
//! `webrequest-hook` uses for its own `tests/e2e.rs`.
//!
//! Coverage:
//! - a real file on disk (not `:memory:`) is written to via the plugin over the C ABI, the plugin
//!   is dropped (closing its connection), then the data is verified to have actually landed in the
//!   file two independent ways: (1) re-`dlopen`ing the SAME cdylib against the SAME path, and
//!   (2) opening the SAME file directly with the plain `busbar-store-sqlite` `SqliteStore`, a code
//!   path that never touches the cdylib, the C ABI, or the loader at all;
//! - a bad config (malformed JSON, or a `db_path` under a nonexistent parent directory) fails
//!   cleanly across the ABI as an `Err`, never a panic or a silently-succeeded load.
