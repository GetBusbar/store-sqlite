//! The built-in SQLite backend for busbar's durable governance store — the default `db` plugin.
//! Implements `busbar_api::store::Store` over embedded rusqlite connections: one mutex-guarded
//! writer, plus a small pool of `query_only` readers so a long billing report or retention sweep
//! never blocks the hot-path usage flush (WAL readers are unaffected by an in-flight writer).
//! Depends only on the `busbar-api` contract (plus rusqlite), never on the engine.

/// `store_revision` adds a store-global monotonic counter for incremental hydration
/// (`list_keys_since`/`list_credentials_since`). `usage_windows` gains a `model` column into its PK
/// (was missing it) and leads with `window_start` (write locality + a contiguous prefix for the
/// retention sweep); `usage_metering` leads with `bucket` for the same write-locality reasoning, and
/// gains `key_group_at_use`/`pricing_version`/`billable_requests`, and renames
/// `tokens_cache_creation` -> `tokens_cache_write` to match `TierTokens`'s own naming (a drift fixed
/// core-side in this same redesign). 1.5.0 is UNRELEASED, so each bump up to and including v5 was
/// destructive (drop + recreate), never a migration: a pre-v5 dev database was recreated empty on
/// open.
///
/// v6: the FIRST real, additive (non-destructive) migration this store has ever needed — a

-- durability by READING THE CHAIN BACK and verifying it; a digest reachable only by decoding an
-- opaque blob forces a deserialise per verify and cannot be constrained or indexed by the database.
-- `body` carries exactly the fields no query filters on. The store NEVER computes or recomputes a
-- digest -- it persists what it was handed, verbatim, and returns it verbatim.
